# 🖼️ VGG16 Image Classification

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook implementation of VGG16** for image classification.  
The project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate the VGG16 deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Uses the **VGG16 architecture** (a well-known CNN model) for image classification.
- Covers data preprocessing, model construction, training, and evaluation.
- Includes visualization of results such as accuracy and loss curves.
- Can be adapted for custom datasets.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aashu7547/VGG16_MODEl.git
cd VGG16_MODEl
2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt


If you don’t have a requirements.txt, install manually:

pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib opencv-python

3. Run the Notebook

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook VGG16.ipynb


Follow the steps in the notebook to:

Load and preprocess dataset

Build/Load VGG16 model

Train the model

Evaluate results
